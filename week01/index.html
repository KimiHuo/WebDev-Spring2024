   <h1>Guide For How to Make Salad
   </h1>
   <p>--Kimi Huo</p>
   <p>This is a brief note about how to make a vegetable salad.</p>
   <h2>What we need:</h2>
   <li>some vegetables</li>
   <li>salad dressings</li>

   <p><b>
    Step1: Wash Your Greens
   </b></p>
   <p>Washing your ingredients is always one of the most important aspects. 
    After all, no one wants to use dirt as a seasoning or 
    find some "meat" in their dish.</p>

 <p><b>
  Step2: Cut Your Vegetables
       </b></p>
       <p>Cut them into smaller pieces if they are big to get into yoour mouth.</p>
   

   <p><b>
    Step3: Mix Them
         </b></p>
         <p>Combine the veggies with the dressing, and any other dressing you 
            want to use (usually pepper, bits of vanilla, sugar, etc. If you want
            have some spicy in your salad, that's fine, I will not stop you from that) into a bowl.</p>

  <p><b>

    </b></p>
